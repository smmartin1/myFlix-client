#myFlix-client
A database app that will allow users to be able to register to a Movie app where they can find a certain movie within the database and add as a favorite or remove from the favorite list. They are also able to update their information and be able to delete their account if they want to.

This project mainly uses JavaScript via React to create an app showing information from a database of movies and users and to perform the four operations of CRUD.

The project depends on multiple packages such as React, Axios, and Redux to request and respond to the databases and to show their information.
